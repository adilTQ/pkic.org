## Quantum is Now

Terra Quantum is a leading quantum technology company based in Germany and Switzerland. It provides "Quantum as a Service (QaaS)“ in three core areas:
- the first one being "Quantum Algorithms as a Service". Here, customers are provided access to an extensive library of algorithms, such as hybrid quantum optimization and hybrid quantum neural networks, which can be used for solving complex logistics problems or pattern recognition, among other things. Terra Quantum also develops new quantum algorithms for its customers or adapts existing algorithms to their specific needs.
- Secondly, through "Quantum Computing as a Service", Terra Quantum offers its customers access to its proprietary high-performance simulated quantum processing units (QPU), the quantum ecosystem’s physical QPUs, while also developing native QPUs.
- The third division is "Quantum Security as a Service," through which Terra Quantum offers its unique solutions for secure quantum and post-quantum communications worldwide.

At Terra Quantum, we are committed to building quantum technology for a better future, breaking down the barriers between science and industry, and laying the foundations of a real quantum tech ecosystem and value chain.

We value the intrinsic connection between our planet and quantum technologies, putting sustainability at the core of our business and culture.

Standing at the very beginning of this revolution we feel the excitement – and responsibility – for the applications and tools we are developing.
